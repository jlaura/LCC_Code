Introduction
------------

The USGS Large Crater Cluster (LCC) Tool is a series of ArcMap tools designed to analyze the spatial distribution of secondary craters to assist in the identification of one or more potential source craters.  This tool was designed to be run using digitized secondaries (points), bounding ellipsoids around visually identified craters (polygons), or best fit lines through visually identified clusters (polylines).

Background

Originally released in XXXX by Skinner and Nava for ArcGIS 9.3, the tool was designed to work with a single body, Mars.  The tool saw use in the analysis of point secondaries around Zunil crater and can be referenced by the following papers and abstracts.
